# 1. Closures

A **closure** is a feature in JavaScript where a function "remembers" the variables and the scope in which it was created, even after that scope has exited.

Closures allow inner functions to access variables from their outer functions even after the outer function has returned.

### **How Closures Work**

1. A function is defined inside another function.
2. The inner function has access to:
   - Its own local variables.
   - Variables of the outer function in which it was defined.
   - Global variables.
3. When the outer function completes, its execution context is removed from the call stack, but the variables it enclosed remain accessible to the inner function through a closure.

### **Anatomy of a Closure**

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = "I am from outer";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accesses outerVariable
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Output: "I am from outer"
```

**Explanation:**

- The `innerFunction` is returned from `outerFunction` and assigned to `closureFunction`.
- Even after `outerFunction` has finished executing, `innerFunction` retains access to `outerVariable` due to the closure.

### **Key Characteristics of Closures**

1. **Preserve State**: Closures can "remember" the variables from their creation context.
2. **Encapsulation**: Closures can hide variables from the outside world.
3. **Scope Chain**: Closures utilize the JavaScript scope chain to access variables.

---

### **Examples**

#### 1. **Preserving State**

```javascript
function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const countInstance = counter();
console.log(countInstance()); // Output: 1
console.log(countInstance()); // Output: 2
```

**Explanation**:

- The `count` variable is private to the `counter` function and is retained by the returned inner function across multiple invocations.

---

#### 2. **Encapsulation**

```javascript
function createSecret(secret) {
  return function () {
    return secret;
  };
}

const getSecret = createSecret("This is a secret!");
console.log(getSecret()); // Output: "This is a secret!"
```

**Explanation**:

- The `secret` variable is inaccessible from the outside but remains accessible to the returned function, creating a secure encapsulation.

---

#### 3. **Using Closures in Loops**

Closures can capture variables in loops to maintain state.

```javascript
function createCallbacks() {
  const callbacks = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    callbacks.push(function () {
      return i;
    });
  }

  return callbacks;
}

const callbacks = createCallbacks();
console.log(callbacks[0]()); // Output: 0
console.log(callbacks[1]()); // Output: 1
console.log(callbacks[2]()); // Output: 2
```

**Explanation**:

- The `i` variable is captured by the closure in each iteration.

---

### **Practical Uses of Closures**

1. **Private Variables**:
   Closures are used to create private variables that cannot be accessed directly.

   ```javascript
   function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
     let balance = initialBalance;

     return {
       deposit(amount) {
         balance += amount;
         return balance;
       },
       withdraw(amount) {
         balance -= amount;
         return balance;
       },
       getBalance() {
         return balance;
       },
     };
   }

   const account = createBankAccount(100);
   console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 100
   console.log(account.deposit(50)); // Output: 150
   ```

2. **Event Handlers**:
   Closures are commonly used in event handlers.

   ```javascript
   function attachEventHandler() {
     const name = "Closure Example";

     document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function () {
       console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
     });
   }

   attachEventHandler();
   ```

3. **Functional Programming**:
   Closures are widely used in functional programming for tasks like currying.

   ```javascript
   function multiplier(factor) {
     return function (number) {
       return number * factor;
     };
   }

   const double = multiplier(2);
   console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
   ```

### **Key Points to Remember**

1. **Memory**: Closures retain references to variables, which can sometimes lead to memory leaks if not managed properly.
2. **Performance**: Using closures in large numbers can increase memory usage due to retained variables.
3. **Debugging**: Debugging closures can be tricky because the retained variables are not explicitly visible in the current context.

---

### **Visualizing the Scope Chain**

- When `closureFunction` is called:
  - JavaScript first checks for `outerVariable` in the local scope.
  - If not found, it looks in the outer scope (`outerFunction`).
  - If still not found, it checks the global scope.
