### **What is Hoisting in JavaScript?**

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable, function, class declarations or imports are moved (or "hoisted") to the top of their containing scope **during the compilation phase**, before the code is executed. This means you can reference these variables or functions before they are actually declared in the code.

However, while declarations are hoisted, **initializations are not**. For variables, this can lead to unexpected behaviors if not understood properly.

### **How Hoisting Works**

1. **Variables Declared with `var`:**

   - The declaration is hoisted to the top of the function or global scope.
   - The variable is initialized to `undefined` during hoisting.

2. **Variables Declared with `let` and `const`:**

   - The declaration is hoisted to the top of the block, but they are not initialized.
   - These variables are in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** from the start of the block until their declaration is encountered in the code.

3. **Function Declarations:**

   - Entire function definitions are hoisted, meaning you can call the function before its declaration in the code.

4. **Function Expressions:**

   - Only the variable declaration (e.g., `var`, `let`, or `const`) is hoisted, not the function definition.

5. **Class Declarations:**
   - Class declarations are hoisted, but they remain in the **TDZ** and cannot be accessed before the declaration.

### **Examples of Hoisting**

#### **1. Hoisting with `var`**

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10

// Hoisting behavior:
var a; // Declaration is hoisted
console.log(a); // undefined (initialized to `undefined`)
a = 10; // Assignment happens
console.log(a); // 10
```

---

#### **2. Hoisting with `let` and `const`**

```javascript
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;

const c = 30;

// Hoisting behavior:
let b; // Declaration is hoisted, but not initialized (TDZ)
const c; // Same for const
```

`let` and `const` remain in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until their actual declaration is encountered. Accessing them before their declaration causes a **ReferenceError**.

---

#### **3. Function Declarations**

```javascript
sayHello(); // "Hello!"

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// Hoisting behavior:
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

Entire function declarations (including their body) are hoisted, so they can be called before their definition in the code.

---

#### **4. Function Expressions**

```javascript
sayGoodbye(); // TypeError: sayGoodbye is not a function
var sayGoodbye = function () {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
};

// Hoisting behavior:
var sayGoodbye; // Declaration is hoisted, but not the function definition
sayGoodbye(); // sayGoodbye is `undefined` at this point
sayGoodbye = function () {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
};
```

Only the variable declaration (`var sayGoodbye`) is hoisted, not the actual function expression.

---

#### **5. Class Declarations**

```javascript
const instance = new MyClass(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'MyClass' before initialization

class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    console.log("Class initialized!");
  }
}

// Hoisting behavior:
class MyClass; // Declaration is hoisted
// Accessing `MyClass` here causes a ReferenceError (TDZ)
```

### **Key Differences Between Hoisting of `var`, `let`, `const`, Functions, and Classes**

| Feature              | Hoisted?              | Initialization    | Accessible Before Declaration? |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `var`                | Yes                   | `undefined`       | Yes (but value is `undefined`) |
| `let`                | Yes                   | Not initialized   | No (TDZ applies)               |
| `const`              | Yes                   | Not initialized   | No (TDZ applies)               |
| Function Declaration | Yes (entire function) | Fully initialized | Yes                            |
| Function Expression  | Yes (variable only)   | Not initialized   | No                             |
| Class Declaration    | Yes                   | Not initialized   | No (TDZ applies)               |

### **Practical Advice to Handle Hoisting**

1. **Declare Variables Before Using Them**:

   - Avoid relying on hoisting for variable declarations to keep your code predictable and readable.

   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   console.log(x); // Good practice
   ```

2. **Use `let` and `const`**:

   - These enforce block scoping and help avoid issues caused by `var` and hoisting.

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     console.log(i);
   }
   ```

3. **Define Functions Before Calling Them**:

   - Even though function declarations are hoisted, defining them first makes the code easier to read.

4. **Understand the Temporal Dead Zone**:
   - Be mindful of the TDZ when using `let`, `const`, or classes.
