# 1. Structured Data in JavaScript

Structured data refers to organizing and storing data in a systematic and accessible way, allowing you to perform efficient operations like searching, updating, and manipulating the data. In JavaScript, structured data is primarily represented using **objects** and **arrays** (built-in data structures). These structures form the foundation for more advanced data structures.

### **Built-in Structured Data Types**

1. **Objects**:

   - Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
   - Keys are strings (or Symbols), and values can be any data type.

   ```javascript
   const user = {
     name: "Alice",
     age: 25,
     hobbies: ["reading", "gaming"],
   };
   console.log(user.name); // "Alice"
   ```

2. **Arrays**:
   - Arrays are ordered collections of elements, indexed by numbers.
   - They can store any type of data and allow duplicate elements.
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   console.log(numbers[0]); // 1
   ```

---

### **Advanced JavaScript Data Structures**

1. **Map**:

   - A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys can be of any type (not limited to strings or symbols like objects).

   ```javascript
   const map = new Map();
   map.set("name", "Alice");
   map.set(1, "one");
   console.log(map.get("name")); // "Alice"
   console.log(map.size); // 2
   ```

2. **Set**:
   - A `Set` is a collection of unique values. Duplicate values are automatically removed.
   ```javascript
   const set = new Set([1, 2, 2, 3]);
   console.log(set); // Set(3) {1, 2, 3}
   console.log(set.has(2)); // true
   ```

---

### **Nested Structures**

1. **Array of Objects**:

   - Commonly used to represent collections of structured data.

   ```javascript
   const users = [
     { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
     { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
   ];
   console.log(users[0].name); // "Alice"
   ```

2. **Object with Nested Objects**:
   - Useful for representing hierarchical or tree-like structures.
   ```javascript
   const company = {
     name: "TechCorp",
     employees: {
       manager: { name: "Alice", age: 40 },
       developer: { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
     },
   };
   console.log(company.employees.manager.name); // "Alice"
   ```

# 2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data. It is easy for humans to read and write and simple for machines to parse and generate. JSON is widely used for communication between a client (e.g., browser) and a server in web applications.

### **Key Features of JSON**

1. **Lightweight and Simple**:
   - Text-based, making it easy to work with and transfer over networks.
2. **Language-Independent**:
   - Although derived from JavaScript, JSON is supported by most programming languages.
3. **Data Interchange**:
   - Commonly used for API responses and configurations.

---

### **JSON Structure**

JSON data is represented using two main structures:

1. **Objects**:

   - Represented as key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Alice",
     "age": 25,
     "isStudent": false
   }
   ```

2. **Arrays**:
   - Represented as an ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
   ```json
   [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

---

### **JSON Data Types**

JSON supports the following data types:

1. **String**:

   - Must be enclosed in double quotes (`""`).

   ```json
   "name": "Alice"
   ```

2. **Number**:

   - Represents integers or floating-point numbers.

   ```json
   "age": 25
   ```

3. **Boolean**:

   - Represents `true` or `false`.

   ```json
   "isStudent": false
   ```

4. **Null**:

   - Represents an empty value.

   ```json
   "address": null
   ```

5. **Array**:

   - An ordered list of values.

   ```json
   "scores": [95, 88, 78]
   ```

6. **Object**:
   - A collection of key-value pairs.
   ```json
   "student": {
     "name": "Alice",
     "age": 25
   }
   ```

### **JSON vs JavaScript Objects**

| Feature        | JSON                                | JavaScript Object          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Format**     | String-based data format            | Native JavaScript type     |
| **Keys**       | Must be in double quotes (`""`)     | Can be unquoted (if valid) |
| **Data Types** | Limited (no `undefined`, functions) | More types supported       |

### **Working with JSON in JavaScript**

1. **Parsing JSON (Convert JSON to JavaScript Object)**:

   - Use `JSON.parse()` to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object.

   ```javascript
   const jsonString = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}';
   const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
   console.log(obj.name); // "Alice"
   ```

2. **Stringifying JSON (Convert JavaScript Object to JSON)**:
   - Use `JSON.stringify()` to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
   const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
   console.log(jsonString); // '{"name":"Alice","age":25}'
   ```

---

### **Use Cases of JSON**

1. **API Communication**:

   - JSON is commonly used to send and receive data between a client and server.

   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "data": {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "Alice"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Configuration Files**:

   - JSON is often used for application configurations.

   ```json
   {
     "appName": "MyApp",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "features": ["login", "signup"]
   }
   ```

3. **Storing Data**:
   - JSON is used in databases like MongoDB and local storage in browsers.
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem("user", '{"name":"Alice","age":25}');
   ```

---

### **Limitations of JSON**

1. **No Functions**:
   - JSON cannot store functions or methods.
2. **No Comments**:
   - Unlike some configuration formats, JSON does not support comments.
3. **Data Types**:
   - JSON does not support `undefined`, `Infinity`, or `NaN`.

---

### **Summary**

- **JSON** is a versatile, text-based format used for data interchange.
- It is easy to use in JavaScript due to built-in methods like `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.
- Widely used for APIs, configurations, and lightweight data storage.
