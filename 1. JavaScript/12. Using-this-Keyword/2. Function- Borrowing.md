# 1. Function Borrowing

Function borrowing is a technique in JavaScript where an object uses a method that belongs to another object, without copying or redefining it. This allows you to "borrow" a function from one object and use it in the context of another object, typically by using the `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()` methods to explicitly set `this`.

### **Why Use Function Borrowing?**

- To avoid duplicating code when multiple objects share a similar behavior.
- To temporarily use a function from one object in the context of another object.

### **How Does Function Borrowing Work?**

It works by invoking a method of one object with `this` explicitly set to another object.

### **Examples of Function Borrowing**

#### **1. Borrowing a Method with `call()`**

You can borrow a method from one object and use it for another object.

```javascript
const person1 = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Smith",
  fullName: function () {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Bob",
  lastName: "Brown",
};

// Borrow `fullName` from `person1` and use it for `person2`
console.log(person1.fullName.call(person2)); // Output: Bob Brown
```

Here, `person2` doesn’t have a `fullName` method, but it can "borrow" it from `person1`.

---

#### **2. Borrowing a Method with `apply()`**

`apply()` is similar to `call()`, but it takes arguments as an array.

```javascript
const person1 = {
  fullName: function (greeting, punctuation) {
    return `${greeting}, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}${punctuation}`;
  },
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Charlie",
  lastName: "Green",
};

// Borrow `fullName` from `person1`
console.log(person1.fullName.apply(person2, ["Hello", "!"])); // Output: Hello, Charlie Green!
```

---

#### **3. Borrowing a Method with `bind()`**

`bind()` creates a new function that permanently sets `this` to a specified object.

```javascript
const person1 = {
  fullName: function () {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Diana",
  lastName: "White",
};

// Borrow `fullName` from `person1` using `bind()`
const getFullName = person1.fullName.bind(person2);

console.log(getFullName()); // Output: Diana White
```

---

### **Common Use Case: Borrowing Array Methods for Array-Like Objects**

Array methods like `slice`, `push`, and `join` are not available on array-like objects (e.g., `arguments`, NodeLists). You can borrow these methods using `call()` or `apply()`.

#### Example: Using `Array.prototype.slice`

```javascript
function example() {
  // `arguments` is an array-like object
  console.log(arguments); // [1, 2, 3] (array-like object)

  // Borrow `slice` to convert `arguments` to a real array
  const args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  console.log(args); // [1, 2, 3] (real array)
}

example(1, 2, 3);
```

### **Benefits of Function Borrowing**

1. **Code Reusability**: Avoid duplicating code for similar methods across multiple objects.
2. **Flexibility**: Use existing methods from other objects without modifying them.
3. **Dynamic Context**: Adapt functions to work with different objects dynamically.

---

### **Things to Keep in Mind**

- Borrowing doesn’t copy the function into the other object; it only changes the `this` context temporarily.
- If a method relies on private variables or properties specific to the original object, it may not work as expected when borrowed.
