### **Understanding Scope and Function Stack**

# 1. Scope :

In JavaScript, **scope** refers to the context in which variables, functions, and objects are accessible or available. It determines the **visibility** or **lifetime** of a variable.

### **Types of Scopes in JavaScript**

1. **Global Scope**:

   - Variables or functions declared outside any function or block are in the global scope.
   - These are accessible anywhere in the code.
   - Global variables are added to the `window` object in browsers.

   **Example**:

   ```javascript
   let globalVar = "I am global";

   function showGlobal() {
     console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
   }

   showGlobal(); // Output: I am global
   console.log(globalVar); // Output: I am global
   ```

2. **Module Scope**:

   - Introduced in **ES6**.
   - When using JavaScript modules (via `import` and `export`), the variables are scoped to the module by default.
   - This prevents pollution of the global scope.

   **Example**:

   ```javascript
   // module1.js
   export const moduleVar = "I am scoped to module1";

   // main.js
   import { moduleVar } from "./module1.js";
   console.log(moduleVar); // Accessible because of the import
   ```

   - Variables and functions in one module are **not accessible** in another module unless explicitly exported/imported.

3. **Function Scope**:

   - Variables declared inside a function using `var`, `let`, or `const` are scoped to that function.
   - These variables cannot be accessed outside the function.

   **Example**:

   ```javascript
   function myFunction() {
     let functionScopedVar = "I am scoped to this function";
     console.log(functionScopedVar); // Accessible here
   }

   myFunction();
   // console.log(functionScopedVar); // Error: functionScopedVar is not defined
   ```

4. **Block Scope**:

   - Introduced in **ES6**.
   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` inside curly braces `{}` are scoped to that block.
   - Variables declared with `var` are **not block-scoped** and can escape the block.

   **Example**:

   ```javascript
   {
     let blockScoped = "I am block scoped";
     console.log(blockScoped); // Accessible here
   }

   // console.log(blockScoped); // Error: blockScoped is not defined
   ```

   - `if`, `for`, and other block structures also create block scopes.

   **Example**:

   ```javascript
   if (true) {
     const conditionScoped = "I am inside an if block";
     console.log(conditionScoped); // Accessible here
   }

   // console.log(conditionScoped); // Error: conditionScoped is not defined
   ```

2. Function Stack (Call stack) :

#### 1. **Execution Contexts**

- **What are Execution Contexts?**

  - Whenever JavaScript code is executed, it operates within an **execution context**, which holds information about the code being executed and the environment in which it runs.
  - The **Global Execution Context** is the first context created when a JavaScript file is executed. It initializes the global scope and sets up the `this` keyword.
  - JavaScript follows a **single-threaded execution model**, meaning it executes one operation at a time, but asynchronous behavior allows for concurrent tasks.

- **Phases of Execution Context**
  - **Memory Phase:** This is where variables and functions are allocated memory and prepared for execution.
  - **Code Phase:** This is where the actual code executes, and operations are performed (functions are invoked, values are assigned, etc.).

#### 2. **Call Stack**

- **What is the Call Stack?**

  - The **call stack** is a data structure that stores all the function calls in the order they are invoked. It follows a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** order, meaning the last function called is the first to be executed.
  - As a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack, and when it finishes execution, it is popped off.

- **How It Works**

  - For example:

    ```javascript
    function first() {
      second();
    }

    function second() {
      console.log("Hello");
    }

    first();
    ```

  - The call stack starts with `first()`, which calls `second()`, and once `second()` finishes, it gets removed, and the flow continues.

- **Potential Issues**
  - If the call stack gets too deep (too many nested function calls), it may result in a **stack overflow** error.

#### 3. **Task Queue vs. Micro-task Queue**

- **Task Queue**

  - The **task queue** (or callback queue) holds regular callback functions that are executed after the main execution context (the call stack) is empty.
  - Functions like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and events are handled in the task queue.

- **Micro-task Queue**
  - The **micro-task queue** is reserved for tasks with higher priority, such as **Promises** and **mutation observers**.
  - Micro-tasks are always executed before tasks in the task queue, ensuring that resolved promises are handled before moving on to other tasks.

#### 4. **Event Loop**

- **What is the Event Loop?**

  - The **event loop** is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, even though it is single-threaded. It checks the call stack and the queues (micro-task and task queues) to determine which tasks should be executed next.
  - The event loop ensures that the **call stack is empty** before checking the **micro-task queue** and then the **task queue**.

- **How It Works**

  - **First**, the event loop checks if the call stack is empty.
  - **Next**, it checks the micro-task queue. If tasks are present, they are executed immediately.
  - **Finally**, it checks the task queue for regular callbacks and processes them.

- **Illustration**
  ```plaintext
  +---------------------+
  |   Event Loop        |
  |                     |
  |  +---------------+  |
  |  | Call Stack    |  |
  |  +---------------+  |
  |  +---------------+  |
  |  | Task Queue    |  |
  |  +---------------+  |
  |  +---------------+  |
  |  | Micro-task Q  |  |
  |  +---------------+  |
  +---------------------+
  ```

#### 5. **setTimeout and Asynchronous Execution**

- **setTimeout and setInterval**

  - `setTimeout` registers a callback to be executed after a specified delay, but it doesn't execute the function immediately.
  - The callback is placed into the **task queue** once the delay has elapsed, allowing the main thread to continue with other operations.

- **Why setTimeout Delays Execution?**

  - The JavaScript engine ensures that the main script executes fully first (the call stack is empty) before placing the `setTimeout` callback into the task queue for execution.

- **Example**

  ```javascript
  console.log("Start");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Delayed");
  }, 1000);

  console.log("End");
  ```

  **Output**:

  ```
  Start
  End
  Delayed
  ```

  The `setTimeout` callback executes only after the main code finishes.

#### 6. **Starvation in the Event Loop**

- **What is Starvation?**

  - Starvation happens when micro-tasks keep getting queued (like promises resolving new promises), preventing tasks in the task queue from being executed.
  - This leads to a situation where the **task queue** is ignored indefinitely, causing potential performance issues.

- **Why Does Starvation Occur?**

  - If there are continuously new promises being resolved, the micro-task queue keeps growing, and the event loop keeps processing it, never getting around to the task queue.

- **Example of Starvation**

  ```javascript
  Promise.resolve()
    .then(() => {
      return Promise.resolve();
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.log("Starvation happens");
    });
  ```

  This creates an endless loop of promises resolving new promises without ever getting to the task queue.

#### 7. **Practical Code Demonstrations**

- **Code Example for Task Queue and Micro-task Queue**

  ```javascript
  console.log("Start");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Task Queue");
  }, 0);

  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Micro-task Queue");
  });

  console.log("End");
  ```

  **Output**:

  ```
  Start
  End
  Micro-task Queue
  Task Queue
  ```

  - The promise in the **micro-task queue** is executed before the `setTimeout` in the **task queue**.

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

- **Execution Context:** The environment in which JavaScript code runs, comprising the global and function execution contexts.
- **Call Stack:** A data structure that manages function invocation in a LIFO order.
- **Task Queue vs. Micro-task Queue:** Task queues handle regular callbacks like `setTimeout`, while micro-tasks handle higher-priority tasks like promises.
- **Event Loop:** A system that ensures non-blocking execution by checking the call stack and the queues to determine what to execute next.
- **setTimeout:** A function that demonstrates delayed asynchronous execution by placing callbacks into the task queue after the main execution context.
- **Starvation:** The issue where micro-tasks can monopolize the event loop, preventing regular tasks from being executed.

By understanding these components, developers can gain deeper insights into JavaScript's execution flow, optimize performance, and create efficient, responsive applications.
