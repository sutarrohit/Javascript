# 1. Object Prototype

- In JavaScript, the **prototype** is an object that is associated with every function and object. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is a key feature of JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance model.

- Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

---

### **Key Concepts of Object Prototype**

1. **Prototype Property (`__proto__`)**:

   - Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (commonly accessed via `__proto__`) that points to its prototype.
   - The prototype is another object from which the current object can inherit methods and properties.

2. **Prototype Chain**:

   - If a property or method is not found in the current object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find it.
   - The chain ends when it reaches `null`, which is the prototype of the base `Object`.

3. **Prototype Object**:
   - Functions in JavaScript have a `prototype` property, which is an object used as a blueprint for creating new objects.

### **Example of Prototype Inheritance**

#### Example 1: Simple Prototype Chain

```javascript
const parent = {
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello from parent!");
  },
};

const child = Object.create(parent); // child inherits from parent
child.greet(); // "Hello from parent!"
```

#### Example 2: Adding Methods to Prototype

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Adding a method to Person's prototype
Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
};

const person1 = new Person("Alice");
person1.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Alice."
```

---

### **Prototype Chain in Action**

1. **Direct Property Lookup**:

   - JavaScript first checks the object itself for a property.

2. **Prototype Lookup**:

   - If the property is not found, JavaScript searches the object's prototype chain.

3. **End of Chain**:
   - If no property is found in the chain, `undefined` is returned.

#### Example:

```javascript
const grandparent = { role: "grandparent" };
const parent = Object.create(grandparent);
const child = Object.create(parent);

console.log(child.role); // "grandparent" (found in grandparent)
```

---

### **Key Properties and Methods**

1. **`Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`**:

   - Returns the prototype of the given object.

   ```javascript
   const obj = {};
   console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); // {}
   ```

2. **`Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`**:

   - Sets the prototype of the given object.

   ```javascript
   const obj = {};
   const prototype = { greet: () => console.log("Hello!") };
   Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype);
   obj.greet(); // "Hello!"
   ```

3. **`__proto__`** (Deprecated but still widely used):
   - Accesses an object’s prototype directly.
   ```javascript
   const obj = {};
   console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
   ```

---

### **Prototype and Constructor Functions**

When a new object is created using a constructor function, it inherits from the constructor’s `prototype` object.

#### Example:

```javascript
function Car(model) {
  this.model = model;
}

Car.prototype.drive = function () {
  console.log(`${this.model} is driving.`);
};

const myCar = new Car("Tesla");
myCar.drive(); // "Tesla is driving."
```

---

### **Prototype Chain Visualization**

Consider this chain:

```javascript
const obj = {};
```

- `obj.__proto__` points to `Object.prototype`.
- `Object.prototype.__proto__` points to `null`.

Chain:

```
obj → Object.prototype → null
```

---

### **Customizing Prototypes**

You can create your own prototypes for shared behavior across objects:

```javascript
const animal = {
  eat: function () {
    console.log("Eating...");
  },
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function () {
  console.log("Barking...");
};

dog.eat(); // "Eating..." (inherited from animal)
dog.bark(); // "Barking..."
```

---

### **Best Practices**

1. **Avoid Modifying Built-in Prototypes**:

   - Modifying prototypes of built-in objects like `Array` or `Object` can lead to conflicts.

   ```javascript
   Array.prototype.customMethod = function () {
     console.log("Custom method");
   };
   ```

2. **Use Object.create() for Prototyping**:

   - Use `Object.create(prototype)` to create objects with a specific prototype.

   ```javascript
   const base = { greet: () => console.log("Hello!") };
   const obj = Object.create(base);
   obj.greet(); // "Hello!"
   ```

3. **Use Classes for Modern Syntax**:
   - In modern JavaScript, use `class` syntax to work with prototypes in a cleaner way.

---

### **Modern JavaScript: Classes and Prototypes**

The `class` syntax in JavaScript is syntactic sugar for working with prototypes.

#### Example:

```javascript
class Animal {
  eat() {
    console.log("Eating...");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log("Barking...");
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
myDog.eat(); // "Eating..."
myDog.bark(); // "Barking..."
```

Under the hood, `class` syntax uses prototypes for inheritance.

---

### **Summary**

- Prototypes enable inheritance in JavaScript.
- Objects inherit from other objects via the prototype chain.
- Functions have a `prototype` property used for inheritance.
- Use modern `class` syntax for a cleaner approach to prototype-based inheritance.
