# 1. if...else :

### **`if...else` Statement in JavaScript**

The `if...else` statement is a fundamental conditional flow control statement in JavaScript. It allows you to execute certain code based on whether a condition is **true** or **false**. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the first block of code inside the `if` statement runs. Otherwise, the code in the `else` block executes.

---

### **Syntax**

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Block of code that runs if the condition is true
} else {
  // Block of code that runs if the condition is false
}
```

- **`condition`**: An expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- **Code Block**: The code inside the `if` or `else` block is executed based on whether the condition is true or false.

---

### **Example: Basic `if...else` Statement**

```javascript
const age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
// Output: You are an adult.
```

- The condition `age >= 18` evaluates to `true`, so the first block inside the `if` statement runs, and the message "You are an adult." is logged.

---

### **Example: `if...else` with `false` Condition**

```javascript
const temperature = 5;

if (temperature > 10) {
  console.log("It's warm outside.");
} else {
  console.log("It's cold outside.");
}
// Output: It's cold outside.
```

- The condition `temperature > 10` evaluates to `false`, so the code inside the `else` block runs.

---

### **`else if` Statement**

You can use multiple conditions with the `else if` clause. If the first `if` condition is `false`, JavaScript will check the conditions in the `else if` block(s) one by one.

#### **Syntax**

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // Block of code that runs if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Block of code that runs if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Block of code that runs if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

---

### **Example: `if...else if...else` Statement**

```javascript
const score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: D");
}
// Output: Grade: B
```

- In this example, `score >= 90` is `false`, so it checks the next condition (`score >= 80`), which is `true`, so "Grade: B" is printed.

---

### **Important Notes**

- **Truthy and Falsy Values**: JavaScript evaluates the condition in the `if` statement as **truthy** or **falsy**. Any value that is not `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, or `NaN` is considered **truthy**.

#### **Example: Truthy and Falsy Values**

```javascript
if (0) {
  console.log("This won't print because 0 is falsy.");
} else {
  console.log("This will print because 0 is falsy.");
}
// Output: This will print because 0 is falsy.
```

---

### **Nested `if...else` Statement**

You can also have `if...else` statements within each other, which is known as **nesting**. This allows for more complex conditional logic.

#### **Example: Nested `if...else`**

```javascript
const age = 20;
const hasPermission = true;

if (age >= 18) {
  if (hasPermission) {
    console.log("You can access the content.");
  } else {
    console.log("You need permission to access the content.");
  }
} else {
  console.log("You are too young to access the content.");
}
// Output: You can access the content.
```

- In this example, the outer `if` checks the `age`, and the inner `if` checks the `hasPermission` value if the first condition is true.

---

### **Ternary Operator (Shortened `if...else`)**

The **ternary operator** is a shorthand way of writing `if...else` statements. It can be useful for simple conditions.

#### **Syntax**

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

- If `condition` is true, `expressionIfTrue` will execute. Otherwise, `expressionIfFalse` will execute.

---

#### **Example: Using Ternary Operator**

```javascript
const age = 16;

const result = age >= 18 ? "You are an adult" : "You are a minor";
console.log(result);
// Output: You are a minor
```

- This is equivalent to the following `if...else` statement:

  ```javascript
  if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult");
  } else {
    console.log("You are a minor");
  }
  ```

---

### **Summary**

- The `if...else` statement allows you to execute code based on a condition.
- You can use `else if` to check multiple conditions.
- Nested `if...else` is useful for more complex logic.
- The ternary operator is a shorthand for simple `if...else` conditions.

# 2. switch

### **`switch` Statement in JavaScript**

The `switch` statement is a conditional statement that evaluates an expression and compares it against multiple possible cases. When it finds a matching case, it executes the corresponding block of code. It's often used when you have multiple conditions that depend on the same variable, making the code more concise and readable compared to using multiple `if...else if` statements.

---

### **Syntax**

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  // More cases as needed
  default:
  // Code to execute if no case matches
}
```

- **`expression`**: The value to be compared against the different cases.
- **`case value`**: Each `case` specifies a value to compare against the `expression`.
- **`break`**: Stops further evaluation of cases once a match is found and the corresponding block of code is executed.
- **`default`**: Optional. Executes if no case matches the `expression`. It's like the `else` in an `if...else` statement.

---

### **How It Works**

1. The `switch` statement evaluates the `expression`.
2. It then compares the value of the `expression` with each `case`.
3. If a match is found, the code associated with that `case` is executed.
4. After executing the matched case, the `break` keyword prevents the remaining cases from being checked (if present).
5. If no match is found, the code in the `default` block (if provided) is executed.

---

### **Example: Basic `switch` Statement**

```javascript
const day = 3;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
// Output: Wednesday
```

- The value of `day` (which is `3`) matches `case 3`, so the corresponding block (`console.log("Wednesday")`) is executed.

---

### **Example: Without `break` (Fall-through)**

If you omit the `break` statement, JavaScript will **fall through** to the next case and continue executing the code, even if a match is found.

```javascript
const day = 2;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
// Output:
// Tuesday
// Wednesday
// Invalid day
```

- Since there's no `break` after `case 1`, JavaScript continues executing the next case (`case 2`) and so on.

To avoid this unintended behavior, always use `break` unless you intentionally want to fall through.

---

### **Example: Using `default` Case**

The `default` case is executed when none of the `case` values match the `expression`. It's optional, but it can be useful for handling unexpected or invalid values.

```javascript
const day = 8;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
// Output: Invalid day
```

- Since `day` is `8`, which doesn't match any of the `case` values, the `default` block is executed.

---

### **Example: Multiple Cases for the Same Code**

You can have multiple `case` values that execute the same code block. This is useful when different values should result in the same action.

```javascript
const fruit = "apple";

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
  case "banana":
  case "cherry":
    console.log("It's a fruit.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown item");
}
// Output: It's a fruit.
```

- In this case, `apple`, `banana`, and `cherry` all trigger the same code block, so "It's a fruit." is logged.

---

### **Using Expressions in `switch`**

You can use an expression or variable in the `switch` statement, not just literals.

```javascript
const number = 10;

switch (true) {
  case number > 0 && number <= 5:
    console.log("Between 1 and 5");
    break;
  case number > 5 && number <= 10:
    console.log("Between 6 and 10");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Out of range");
}
// Output: Between 6 and 10
```

- Here, we use an expression (`true`) and compare conditions in the `case` statements. This allows more flexibility.

---

### **Summary of `switch` Statement**

- The `switch` statement is useful for testing a single expression against multiple possible values.
- It improves readability and performance compared to using multiple `if...else` statements for simple value checks.
- The `default` case handles any values that don't match the defined cases.
- **Fall-through behavior** occurs when `break` is omitted, and multiple cases will execute in sequence.
