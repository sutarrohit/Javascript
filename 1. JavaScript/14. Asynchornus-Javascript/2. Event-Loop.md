# 1. Event Loop

The **event loop** is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows the language to perform non-blocking asynchronous operations, despite being single-threaded. It handles the execution of multiple operations by managing the interaction between the **call stack**, **Web APIs**, and **task queues**.

### **How the Event Loop Works**

#### **Key Components**

1. **Call Stack**:

   - The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls.
   - Functions are pushed onto the stack when called and popped off when they return.
   - Synchronous code is executed directly on the call stack.

2. **Web APIs**:

   - Browser-provided or Node.js-provided APIs that handle asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, DOM events, etc.
   - These operations run outside the call stack.

3. **Task Queue (Macro-Task Queue)**:

   - A queue where callbacks from asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or DOM events are placed.
   - The event loop pulls tasks from this queue when the call stack is empty.

4. **Microtask Queue**:

   - A queue for high-priority asynchronous tasks, like those created by promises or `MutationObserver`.
   - Microtasks are processed before tasks in the task queue.

5. **Event Loop**:
   - Continuously checks the call stack for tasks to execute.
   - If the call stack is empty, it pulls tasks from the **microtask queue** first, then from the **task queue**.

### **Execution Flow**

1. Synchronous code is executed first in the **call stack**.
2. When an asynchronous function is encountered:
   - It is offloaded to Web APIs.
   - A callback is placed in the appropriate queue (task or microtask) after the operation completes.
3. The event loop checks the **call stack**:
   - If empty, it processes **microtasks** first.
   - Then, it processes tasks from the **task queue**.
4. This cycle repeats indefinitely.

### **Example: Basic Event Loop**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

**Execution Breakdown**:

1. `"Start"` is logged (synchronous).
2. `setTimeout` schedules a callback in the **task queue**.
3. `Promise.resolve()` schedules a callback in the **microtask queue**.
4. `"End"` is logged (synchronous).
5. The event loop processes the **microtask queue** first:
   - Logs `"Promise"`.
6. Then processes the **task queue**:
   - Logs `"Timeout"`.

**Output**:

```
Start
End
Promise
Timeout
```

### **Microtask vs Task**

Microtasks (e.g., `Promise.then`, `MutationObserver`) have higher priority than tasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`).

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("Task"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Microtask"));
```

**Output**:

```
Microtask
Task
```

### **Event Loop in Action**

#### **Example 1: Nested Tasks**

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Task 1");
  Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Microtask 1"));
}, 0);

setTimeout(() => console.log("Task 2"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Microtask 2"));

console.log("Start");
```

**Execution Breakdown**:

1. Synchronous `"Start"` is logged.
2. `Promise.resolve()` schedules `"Microtask 2"`.
3. Two `setTimeout` callbacks are added to the task queue.
4. `"Microtask 2"` runs (microtask queue is processed first).
5. `"Task 1"` runs (task queue starts processing).
6. `"Microtask 1"` runs (microtask triggered by Task 1).
7. `"Task 2"` runs.

**Output**:

```
Start
Microtask 2
Task 1
Microtask 1
Task 2
```

### **Why is the Event Loop Important?**

1. **Non-blocking I/O**: Allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, like file reading, network requests, or user interactions.
2. **Responsive UI**: Prevents the browser's main thread from freezing by offloading heavy operations.
3. **Control Flow**: Understanding the event loop helps debug code behavior when dealing with asynchronous operations.
