# 1. Built-in Objects

JavaScript provides a rich set of **built-in objects** that are predefined by the language. These objects are available globally and provide methods and properties to simplify common programming tasks such as working with numbers, strings, dates, arrays, and more.

---

### **Types of Built-in Objects**

1. **Global Objects**:

   - These are always available in the global scope, such as `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, and `Math`.

2. **Utility Objects**:

   - Provide utilities for various tasks, such as `JSON`, `Promise`, and `Reflect`.

3. **Error Objects**:

   - Used for handling exceptions, such as `Error`, `TypeError`, and `SyntaxError`.

4. **DOM and BOM Objects** (in browsers):
   - Used for web development, such as `document`, `window`, and `console`.

|                     | `WeakSet`        | Similar to `Set` but holds "weak" references to its values.                                      |
|                     | `WeakMap`        | Similar to `Map` but holds "weak" references to its keys.                                        |

### **Examples of Using Built-in Objects**

#### 1. **Object**

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ["name", "age"]
console.log(Object.values(obj)); // ["Alice", 25]
```

#### 2. **Array**

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.length); // 3
console.log(arr.map((x) => x * 2)); // [2, 4, 6]
```

#### 3. **Math**

```javascript
console.log(Math.PI); // 3.141592653589793
console.log(Math.sqrt(16)); // 4
```

#### 4. **Date**

```javascript
const now = new Date();
console.log(now.toDateString()); // e.g., "Sat Jan 13 2025"
```

#### 5. **JSON**

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}';
const parsed = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(parsed.name); // "Alice"
```

### **Why Built-in Objects are Important**

1. **Simplifies Common Tasks**:

   - Provides ready-to-use methods for data manipulation, string operations, and more.

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:

   - Ensures consistent behavior across different JavaScript environments.

3. **Foundation for Custom Objects**:
   - Most custom objects in JavaScript are created by extending or interacting with these built-in objects.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Start by exploring the most commonly used objects like `Object`, `Array`, and `String`.
- Experiment with their methods and properties in a JavaScript environment.
- Gradually dive into more advanced objects like `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise`.

Let me know which object you want to learn about in detail!

Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
