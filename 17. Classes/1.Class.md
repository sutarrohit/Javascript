# 1. JavaScript Classes

- In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. It encapsulates data and behavior and provides a more structured and cleaner way to define objects compared to traditional prototypes.

- Classes in JavaScript are a syntactic sugar over the prototypal inheritance model. They were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

## **1. Class Basic Syntax**

### **What Are Classes?**

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It simplifies the process of creating multiple similar objects by grouping together properties (data) and methods (behaviors).

### **Key Components of a Class**

1. **Constructor Method**: Special method used for initializing objects.
2. **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class, representing object behaviors.
3. **Instance Properties**: Variables specific to each instance of the class.

### **Example**

```javascript
class Person {
  // Constructor: Initializes the object
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName; // Instance property
    this.lastName = lastName; // Instance property
  }

  // Method: Defines object behavior
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}

// Create instances of the class
const person1 = new Person("Alice", "Johnson");
const person2 = new Person("Bob", "Smith");

console.log(person1.getFullName()); // Alice Johnson
console.log(person2.getFullName()); // Bob Smith
```

### **Behind the Scenes**

- JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over the **prototype-based inheritance** system.
- The methods defined in the class are actually stored in the prototype of the objects created by the class.

---

## **2. Class Inheritance**

### **What Is Inheritance?**

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes reusability and hierarchical structuring.

### **How It Works**

- The `extends` keyword indicates that a class is inheriting from another class.
- The `super()` function is used to call the constructor or methods of the parent class.

### **Detailed Example**

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Method in the parent class
  eat() {
    return `${this.name} is eating.`;
  }
}

class Bird extends Animal {
  constructor(name, wingSpan) {
    super(name); // Call the parent class's constructor
    this.wingSpan = wingSpan; // Additional property for Bird
  }

  // Override the eat method
  eat() {
    return `${this.name} is pecking at food.`;
  }

  fly() {
    return `${this.name} is flying with a wingspan of ${this.wingSpan} meters.`;
  }
}

const sparrow = new Bird("Sparrow", 0.25);
console.log(sparrow.eat()); // Sparrow is pecking at food.
console.log(sparrow.fly()); // Sparrow is flying with a wingspan of 0.25 meters.
```

### **Key Points**

- **Method Overriding**: Subclasses can redefine parent methods.
- **Access Parent Methods**: Use `super.methodName()` to call a parent method explicitly.

---

## **3. Static Properties and Methods**

### **What Are Static Properties and Methods?**

Static members belong to the class itself and are shared across all instances. They are used for utility functions or constants that don’t depend on individual instances.

### **Defining Static Properties and Methods**

```javascript
class Calculator {
  // Static property
  static pi = 3.14159;

  // Static method
  static multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}

// Access static members directly through the class
console.log(Calculator.pi); // 3.14159
console.log(Calculator.multiply(3, 4)); // 12

// Static members cannot be accessed through an instance
const calc = new Calculator();
// console.log(calc.pi); // Error
```

### **Why Use Static Members?**

- **Shared Functionality**: Useful for constants, utility functions, or shared behavior.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Static members are created only once, reducing memory usage.

---

## **4. Private and Protected Properties and Methods**

### **Private Properties and Methods**

Private members are used to restrict access to certain properties or methods, ensuring encapsulation. They are declared with the `#` symbol.

### **Example**

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // Private property

  constructor(owner) {
    this.owner = owner;
  }

  // Public method accessing private property
  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
    return `Deposited ${amount}. Current balance: ${this.#balance}`;
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount > this.#balance) {
      return "Insufficient funds.";
    }
    this.#balance -= amount;
    return `Withdrew ${amount}. Remaining balance: ${this.#balance}`;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount("John");
console.log(account.deposit(1000)); // Deposited 1000. Current balance: 1000
console.log(account.withdraw(500)); // Withdrew 500. Remaining balance: 500
// console.log(account.#balance); // Error: Cannot access private property
```

### **Protected Properties and Methods**

JavaScript does not have true **protected** fields, but you can simulate them by:

- Using `_` as a naming convention for protected fields.
- Using closures or `WeakMap`.

---

## **5. Extending Built-In Classes**

### **What Is It?**

You can create custom classes that extend built-in JavaScript classes like `Array`, `Error`, or `Date`.

### **Example: Extending Array**

```javascript
class CustomArray extends Array {
  findMax() {
    return Math.max(...this);
  }
}

const numbers = new CustomArray(10, 20, 30, 40);
console.log(numbers.findMax()); // 40
```

### **Example: Extending Error**

```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "CustomError";
  }
}

try {
  throw new CustomError("Something went wrong!");
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.name); // CustomError
  console.log(e.message); // Something went wrong!
}
```

---

## **6. Class Checking: `instanceof`**

### **What Is `instanceof`?**

The `instanceof` operator checks whether an object belongs to a specific class or its parent classes.

### **Example**

```javascript
class Vehicle {}
class Car extends Vehicle {}

const myCar = new Car();

console.log(myCar instanceof Car); // true
console.log(myCar instanceof Vehicle); // true
console.log(myCar instanceof Object); // true
```

### **Key Points**

- Useful for verifying the type of an object.
- Works with inheritance and prototypes.

---

## **7. Mixins**

### **What Are Mixins?**

Mixins allow multiple behaviors to be added to a class by combining objects or functions. They help share functionality across unrelated classes.

### **Example**

```javascript
const flyMixin = {
  fly() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying.`);
  },
};

const swimMixin = {
  swim() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is swimming.`);
  },
};

class Bird {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// Mix in additional behaviors
Object.assign(Bird.prototype, flyMixin, swimMixin);

const duck = new Bird("Duck");
duck.fly(); // Duck is flying.
duck.swim(); // Duck is swimming.
```

### **Key Points**

- Mixins provide flexibility to extend functionality without inheritance.
- Use `Object.assign` to combine mixins into a class prototype.
