Variables can be declared using three keywords: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

---

### **1. `var`**

- **Scope:** Function-scoped (available only inside the function in which they are declared).
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, but their value remains `undefined` until the line of assignment is executed.
- **Re-declaration:** Can be re-declared in the same scope.

```javascript
function exampleVar() {
  console.log(x); // undefined (hoisted)
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
exampleVar();

var y = 5;
var y = 10; // Allowed
console.log(y); // 10
```

**Usage:** `var` is considered outdated and is generally replaced by `let` or `const` in modern JavaScript.

### Behavior in Loops :

- Var in loops can lead to unintended results because var does not have block scopeâ€”it is function-scoped.

- Variables declared with var inside a loop are not limited to the loop block; instead, they are accessible throughout the function in which they are declared.

- This behavior can cause issues, especially in asynchronous operations like setTimeout or Promises, because the same var variable is shared across all iterations of the loop.

```javascript
function loopWithVar() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i); // The output will be 3,3,3
    }, 100);
  }
}

loopWithVar();
```

### **2. `let`**

- **Scope:** Block-scoped (limited to the block `{ ... }` in which they are declared).
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with `let` are hoisted but remain in a "temporal dead zone" until they are initialized.
- **Re-declaration:** Cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

```javascript
function exampleLet() {
  // console.log(a); // ReferenceError (temporal dead zone)
  let a = 20;
  console.log(a); // 20
}
exampleLet();

// let b = 15;
// let b = 30; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
```

**Usage:** Use `let` for variables that need to change their value (mutable) and are block-scoped.

---

### **3. `const`**

- **Scope:** Block-scoped, like `let`.
- **Hoisting:** Similar to `let`, `const` variables are hoisted but are in the temporal dead zone until initialized.
- **Re-declaration and Re-assignment:** Cannot be re-declared or re-assigned after initialization.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
console.log(PI); // 3.14159

// PI = 3.14; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
// const PI = 3; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'PI' has already been declared
```

- **Mutable References:** If the variable refers to an object or array, the contents of the object/array can be modified, but the reference cannot be changed.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// arr = [5, 6]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

**Usage:** Use `const` for values that should remain constant (immutable references).

### Choosing Between `var`, `let`, and `const`

- **Use `const` by default.**
- Use `let` when you need to reassign a value.
- Avoid `var` unless maintaining legacy code.

### Examples: Practical Differences

```javascript
function demo() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5; // function-scoped
    let y = 10; // block-scoped
    const z = 15; // block-scoped
  }

  console.log(x); // 5
  // console.log(y); // ReferenceError
  // console.log(z); // ReferenceError
}
demo();
```
