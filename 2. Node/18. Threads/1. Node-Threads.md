# **Node.js Threads - Understanding Single-Threaded & Parallel Processing**

### **1. Introduction to Node.js Threads**

Node.js is often referred to as **single-threaded**, but it has mechanisms to **work in parallel** using multiple threads when needed. This makes it efficient for **I/O-heavy tasks** but presents challenges for **CPU-bound tasks**.

---

## **2. What Does "Single-Threaded" Mean in Node.js?**

üîπ **Single-threaded** means that Node.js runs all JavaScript code on a **single main thread**, using the **event loop** to handle multiple tasks asynchronously.  
üîπ Unlike languages like Java or Python, which use **multi-threading** for concurrent tasks, Node.js uses a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**.  
üîπ This makes **Node.js highly memory-efficient** and great for handling **thousands of concurrent requests**.

### **Example: Single-Threaded Execution**

```js
console.log("Task 1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Task 2 (delayed)");
}, 2000);

console.log("Task 3");
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Task 1
Task 3
Task 2 (delayed)
```

Even though **Task 2** is delayed, the **main thread keeps executing other code** instead of waiting.

---

## **3. Why Does Node.js Use a Single Thread?**

- **Memory Efficiency**: A single-threaded event loop consumes **less RAM** than multi-threaded programs.
- **Simplifies Development**: No need to worry about **deadlocks, race conditions, or complex thread management**.
- **Optimized for I/O Tasks**: Ideal for web servers, API requests, and database operations.

‚ùå However, Node.js **struggles with CPU-intensive tasks**, such as **complex calculations, image processing, and large data transformations**.

---

## **4. How Node.js Works with Multiple Threads?**

Even though the **main execution** is single-threaded, Node.js **uses multiple threads under the hood** for tasks like:

- **File system operations** (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`)
- **Cryptographic operations** (`crypto.pbkdf2`, `crypto.scrypt`)
- **Compression (zlib)**
- **DNS lookups**
- **Worker Threads (for parallel execution)**

### **Node.js Handles Parallelism in Two Ways:**

1. **Thread Pool (libuv)**
2. **Worker Threads API**

---

## **5. Thread Pool in Node.js (`libuv`)**

Node.js is built on **libuv**, which creates a **thread pool** to handle CPU-heavy operations **asynchronously**. The default number of threads in the pool is **4**, but it can be increased.

### **Example: Thread Pool in Action (Crypto Hashing)**

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

console.time("Hashing");
crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.timeEnd("Hashing");
});
```

‚úÖ Runs a **CPU-intensive password hash** in the background without blocking the main thread.

---

## **6. Increasing Thread Pool Size**

By default, Node.js has **4 threads** in its pool. You can increase this using **`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`**.

```sh
UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 node app.js
```

‚úÖ **Increases parallel processing** for tasks like hashing, file operations, and encryption.

---

## **7. Worker Threads in Node.js**

üîπ **Worker threads** allow **true multi-threading** in Node.js.  
üîπ Unlike the thread pool, which is used **internally by Node.js**, **worker threads let you create and manage your own threads**.

### **Installation**

Worker threads are **built into Node.js 10+**, no extra installation is needed.

### **Example: Creating a Worker Thread**

```js
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  console.log("Main thread running");

  // Create a new worker
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  worker.on("message", (msg) => console.log("Message from worker:", msg));
} else {
  console.log("Worker thread running");
  parentPort.postMessage("Hello from worker!");
}
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
Main thread running
Worker thread running
Message from worker: Hello from worker!
```

### **Why Use Worker Threads?**

- **Best for CPU-heavy tasks** (complex calculations, data processing).
- **Runs parallel to the main thread** (doesn‚Äôt block the event loop).
- **Uses multiple CPU cores efficiently**.

## **8. When to Use Worker Threads vs. Thread Pool?**

| Feature                      | Thread Pool (libuv)      | Worker Threads             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Managed by**               | Node.js (libuv)          | Developer                  |
| **Use Case**                 | File system, crypto, DNS | CPU-intensive calculations |
| **Parallel Execution**       | Background execution     | True multi-threading       |
| **Custom Thread Management** | No                       | Yes                        |

---

## **9. Example: Running Heavy Computation in Worker Threads**

```js
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");

console.log("Starting computation...");

const worker = new Worker(
  `
  const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) sum += i;
  parentPort.postMessage(sum);
`,
  { eval: true }
);

worker.on("message", (result) => {
  console.log("Computation result:", result);
});
```

‚úÖ This runs a **huge computation** in a separate thread, keeping the **main thread responsive**.

| **Use Case Example**      | Web servers, REST APIs               | File reads, encryption      | Image processing, AI       |
