# **PM2 - Process Manager for Node.js**

## **1. What is PM2?**

**PM2 (Process Manager 2)** is a **production-ready process manager** for Node.js applications that helps you:  
✅ **Keep applications running continuously** (auto-restart if they crash).  
✅ **Manage multiple Node.js processes** for better performance.  
✅ **Monitor application logs, CPU, and memory usage**.  
✅ **Auto-start applications on server reboot**.

🔹 PM2 is widely used for **deploying Node.js applications in production**.  
🔹 It ensures that **your app stays live 24/7** by restarting automatically when failures occur.

---

## **2. Installing PM2**

Install PM2 globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g pm2
```

Verify installation:

```sh
pm2 --version
```

---

## **3. Starting a Node.js Application with PM2**

To start a Node.js app using PM2:

```sh
pm2 start app.js
```

🚀 This runs `app.js` in the background, ensuring it restarts on failures.

✅ **Alternative: Start with a custom name**

```sh
pm2 start app.js --name myApp
```

Now, `pm2` will track your app as **"myApp"** instead of `app.js`.

---

## **4. Listing Running Applications**

To view all running applications:

```sh
pm2 list
```

🔹 This shows the process **ID, status, CPU, memory usage**, and restart count.

Example output:

```
┌───────┬───────────┬─────────┬──────┬───────┬──────────┐
│ ID    │ Name      │ Status  │ CPU  │ Memory │ Restarts │
├───────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────┼───────┼──────────┤
│ 0     │ myApp     │ online  │ 0.3% │ 40MB  │ 1        │
└───────┴───────────┴─────────┴──────┴───────┴──────────┘
```

✅ **Process ID (`ID`) is used to manage apps** (e.g., stop, restart).

---

## **5. Restarting and Stopping Applications**

### Restart an application:

```sh
pm2 restart myApp
```

or restart by **ID**:

```sh
pm2 restart 0
```

### Stop an application:

```sh
pm2 stop myApp
```

### Delete an application:

```sh
pm2 delete myApp
```

✅ Stopping keeps it in the PM2 process list, but deleting removes it completely.

---

## **6. Running Multiple Instances (Cluster Mode)**

By default, Node.js runs on **a single CPU core**. PM2 can start multiple instances using the **cluster mode** for better performance.

### **Example: Run on All CPU Cores**

```sh
pm2 start app.js -i max
```

🔹 This automatically **detects CPU cores** and runs one process per core.

### **Example: Run on 4 Instances**

```sh
pm2 start app.js -i 4
```

✅ **Cluster Mode Benefits:**

- Load is balanced across multiple instances.
- Improves performance for high-traffic apps.
- If one instance crashes, others keep running.

---

## **7. Logging with PM2**

PM2 captures logs automatically.

### **View Logs in Real-Time**

```sh
pm2 logs
```

🔹 Shows **live logs of all running applications**.

### **View Logs for a Specific Application**

```sh
pm2 logs myApp
```

### **Clear Logs**

```sh
pm2 flush
```

✅ Useful when logs grow too large.

---

## **8. Auto-Restart on Server Reboot**

To ensure PM2-managed apps restart when the server reboots:

```sh
pm2 startup
```

🔹 This generates a command (e.g., `sudo pm2 startup systemd`), which you must run.

---

## **9. Saving and Restoring PM2 Processes**

After setting up your apps, save the PM2 process list:

```sh
pm2 save
```

This ensures PM2 reloads the apps when the system restarts.

To restore saved processes after a reboot:

```sh
pm2 resurrect
```

---

## **10. Monitoring Application Performance**

PM2 provides a monitoring dashboard:

```sh
pm2 monit
```

🚀 Shows **CPU, memory, and process status in real-time**.

---

## **11. Managing Environment Variables**

Use `--env` to load different configurations.

### **Example: Start an app in production mode**

```sh
pm2 start app.js --name myApp --env production
```

or use **environment files** (`ecosystem.config.js`).

---

## **12. Running a Script Periodically (Cron Jobs with PM2)**

Example: Run a script every 10 seconds:

```sh
pm2 start script.js --cron "*/10 * * * * *"
```

✅ Useful for **scheduled tasks** (like backups or API calls).

---

## **13. PM2 with Ecosystem File (Configuration File)**

You can define process settings in `ecosystem.config.js`.

### **Example: `ecosystem.config.js`**

```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: "myApp",
      script: "server.js",
      instances: "max",
      exec_mode: "cluster",
      env: {
        NODE_ENV: "development",
      },
      env_production: {
        NODE_ENV: "production",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Start using:

```sh
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

✅ Easier than managing multiple `pm2` commands.

---

## **14. Uninstalling PM2**

If you want to remove PM2 completely:

```sh
pm2 uninstall pm2
```

🚀 This stops all running processes and removes PM2.
