# 1. Debugger in Node.js :

The **Node.js debugger** allows you to pause code execution, step through code, and inspect variables during runtime. It's an essential tool for debugging and helps in identifying issues in your application.

---

## **1. Starting the Node.js Debugger**

You can start the **Node.js debugger** by running the following command:

```sh
node inspect <your-script.js>
```

For example, if you have a script `app.js`:

```sh
node inspect app.js
```

Once the script runs, it enters **debug mode** and waits for commands.

---

## **2. Basic Debugger Commands**

After starting the debugger, you will see the prompt `debug>`. Here are the most common commands:

### **a. `n` (Next)**

- Steps to the **next line of code** within the current function.

```sh
debug> n
```

### **b. `c` (Continue)**

- Continues running the script until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.

```sh
debug> c
```

### **c. `s` (Step)**

- Steps **into** a function call, allowing you to inspect the functionâ€™s execution line by line.

```sh
debug> s
```

### **d. `o` (Out)**

- Steps **out** of the current function and moves to the line after the function call.

```sh
debug> o
```

### **e. `repl`**

- Launches an interactive **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)** to evaluate code during debugging. This allows you to check the current state of variables or run arbitrary JavaScript code.

```sh
debug> repl
```

Example:

```sh
debug> repl
> variableName
```

### **f. `watch`**

- Lets you **watch expressions** and automatically logs their values every time they change.

```sh
debug> watch('variableName')
```

---

## **3. Breakpoints in the Debugger**

You can set breakpoints at specific lines in the code to pause execution at that point.

### **a. Setting a Breakpoint**

To set a breakpoint at a specific line number:

```sh
debug> sb(10)  // Set a breakpoint at line 10
```

### **b. Setting Breakpoints by Function Name**

You can set breakpoints by function name as well:

```sh
debug> sb('myFunction')
```

### **c. Viewing Breakpoints**

To view all the set breakpoints:

```sh
debug> bp
```

### **d. Removing Breakpoints**

To remove a breakpoint:

```sh
debug> clear 10  // Removes the breakpoint on line 10
```

---

## **4. Debugging with `node inspect` and Chrome DevTools**

Node.js also supports debugging with **Chrome DevTools**, which provides a GUI for inspecting variables, watching expressions, and stepping through code.

### **a. Launch Node.js in Debug Mode**

```sh
node --inspect-brk <your-script.js>
```

- The `--inspect-brk` flag tells Node.js to **pause execution** immediately on startup.

### **b. Open Chrome DevTools**

- Open **Google Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.
- Click on **"Open dedicated DevTools for Node"**.
- This opens a debugging window where you can control execution, inspect variables, and set breakpoints.

## **5. Using `debug` Module for Logging**

While the built-in Node.js debugger is great for step-by-step debugging, you can also use the `debug` module for **logging specific messages** to help debug.

### **a. Install the `debug` module**

```sh
npm install debug
```

### **b. Using `debug` for Logging**

```js
const debug = require("debug")("app"); // 'app' is the namespace

debug("This is a debug message");
```

### **c. Running with Debugging Enabled**

To see the debug logs, run your script with the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```sh
DEBUG=app node app.js
```

This will show the logs only when the `debug()` function is called with the correct namespace.

---

## **6. Debugging Asynchronous Code**

Debugging asynchronous code is trickier because execution can happen out of order. However, the debugger can still help you track asynchronous calls by pausing execution at breakpoints and stepping through the promise chain or callback functions.

### **Example: Debugging Async Code**

```js
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await getDataFromAPI();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```

To debug this, you can:

1. Set breakpoints inside the `fetchData()` function.
2. Use `n` (Next) to step through each line.
3. Inspect the data returned by `getDataFromAPI()` using the `repl` command.

---

## **7. Debugging in VS Code**

If you use **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, you can set up an integrated debugger.

### **a. Setup Debugging Configuration**

1. Open VS Code and go to the **Run** panel (left sidebar).
2. Click **Create a launch.json file**.
3. Select **Node.js** and configure it like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **b. Setting Breakpoints in VS Code**

- Open the file in the editor.
- Click on the left margin next to the line number to set a breakpoint.

### **c. Start Debugging**

- Press **F5** to start debugging.
- VS Code will pause at the breakpoint and allow you to inspect variables, step through the code, and evaluate expressions.

---

## **8. Debugging Best Practices**

- **Set meaningful breakpoints**: Focus on key areas where the issue is likely to occur.
- **Use `repl`**: Evaluate expressions and inspect variable states during debugging.
- **Use the `debug` module** for simple logging and to enable logging without affecting production code.
- **Leverage DevTools for a graphical debugging experience**: This is especially helpful for complex applications.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Node.js debugger** is a powerful tool for step-by-step debugging and troubleshooting. Whether using the built-in Node.js debugger, the `debug` module, or Chrome DevTools, proper debugging techniques will make your development process more efficient. ðŸš€
