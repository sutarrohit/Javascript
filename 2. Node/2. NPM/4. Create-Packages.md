# **Creating Packages in npm (Publishing & Managing Your Own npm Package)**

If you want to **share your own JavaScript/Node.js library** with others, you can create and publish a package to **npm**. Let's go step by step to understand how to do it.

---

## **1. Setting Up an npm Package**

### **Step 1: Initialize the Package**

Create a new directory for your package:

```sh
mkdir my-awesome-package
cd my-awesome-package
```

Now, initialize it with:

```sh
npm init
```

or (to skip prompts and use default settings):

```sh
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A cool npm package",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"No test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

- `name` → The package name (must be unique on npm).
- `version` → Starts at `1.0.0`, follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.
- `main` → Entry point (`index.js` by default).
- `license` → `MIT`, `ISC`, etc. (defines usage terms).

---

### **Step 2: Write Code for Your Package**

Inside `my-awesome-package/`, create `index.js`:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

module.exports = greet;
```

Now, anyone who installs your package can use it like:

```js
const greet = require("my-awesome-package");
console.log(greet("Rohit"));
```

---

## **2. Testing Your Package Locally**

Before publishing, **test it in another project**.

### **Step 1: Link the Package Locally**

```sh
npm link
```

This makes your package globally available.

### **Step 2: Use It in Another Project**

Go to another project folder and run:

```sh
npm link my-awesome-package
```

Now, require it in `test.js`:

```js
const greet = require("my-awesome-package");
console.log(greet("World"));
```

If it works correctly, it's ready to publish!

---

## **3. Publishing Your Package on npm**

### **Step 1: Create an npm Account**

If you haven’t, create an npm account at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Login from the terminal:

```sh
npm login
```

It will ask for your **username, password, and email**.

---

### **Step 2: Publish the Package**

To publish a public package:

```sh
npm publish
```

If you see an error about the package name being taken, rename it in `package.json`.

---

## **4. Installing and Using the Published Package**

Now, anyone can install your package using:

```sh
npm install my-awesome-package
```

And use it in their code:

```js
const greet = require("my-awesome-package");
console.log(greet("Developer"));
```

---

## **5. Updating Your Package**

If you make changes, update the version in `package.json` (following **SemVer**):

- **Bug fix** → Increment PATCH (`1.0.1`)
- **New feature (backward compatible)** → Increment MINOR (`1.1.0`)
- **Breaking changes** → Increment MAJOR (`2.0.0`)

Then, publish the update:

```sh
npm version patch  # Updates to 1.0.1
npm publish
```

---

## **6. Unpublishing a Package**

If you need to **remove** a package:

```sh
npm unpublish my-awesome-package --force
```

**⚠ Note:** Packages cannot be unpublished after 72 hours unless scoped.

---

## **7. Publishing a Private Package**

If you want to **publish a package only for internal use**, make it **private**:

```json
{
  "name": "@your-company/my-private-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true
}
```

Then publish it to a private npm registry:

```sh
npm publish --access restricted
```

---

## **8. Common Errors and Solutions**

| Error                         | Cause                                               | Solution                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm ERR! name already taken` | Someone else published a package with the same name | Change the `"name"` in `package.json`                         |
| `403 Forbidden`               | Not logged in                                       | Run `npm login`                                               |
| `Cannot unpublish a package`  | The package was published over 72 hours ago         | Deprecate it instead (`npm deprecate package-name "Message"`) |

### **Conclusion**

✅ npm packages allow you to share your code with others.  
✅ You can **test locally with `npm link`** before publishing.  
✅ Use **Semantic Versioning** to manage updates.  
✅ **Private packages** can be published for internal use.
