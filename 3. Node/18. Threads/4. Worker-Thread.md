# **Worker Threads in Node.js - Complete Guide**

## **1. What are Worker Threads in Node.js?**

ðŸ”¹ **Worker threads** allow **multi-threading** in Node.js, enabling **parallel execution** of JavaScript code in **separate threads** without blocking the main event loop.  
ðŸ”¹ **Unlike child processes**, **worker threads** **share memory** with the main thread and other workers, making communication between them **faster** and more efficient.  
ðŸ”¹ Worker threads are primarily used for **CPU-intensive operations** that would normally block the event loop, such as complex calculations, image processing, data parsing, and machine learning tasks.

---

## **2. Worker Threads vs Child Processes**

While both **worker threads** and **child processes** allow parallel execution in Node.js, they differ significantly in terms of how they manage resources and communicate:

- **Worker Threads**:
  - Run in the **same memory space** as the main thread.
  - **Shared memory** allows faster communication.
  - Ideal for **parallel JavaScript code execution**.
- **Child Processes**:
  - Run in a **separate memory space**.
  - Communication via **IPC (Inter-process communication)** is slower.
  - Ideal for **running external commands or different Node.js processes**.

---

## **3. How Worker Threads Work**

Worker threads allow JavaScript code to run in parallel without blocking the main thread. Workers run in **isolated threads**, where the main thread and workers can exchange data via **messages**.

### **Basic Workflow**

1. **Main Thread** creates a worker thread.
2. The worker thread **executes** a piece of code (e.g., a computation or task).
3. The main thread and the worker thread communicate using **message passing**.
4. Once the task is complete, the worker **sends a message back** to the main thread and **terminates**.

---

## **4. Setting Up Worker Threads**

### **Installing Worker Threads**

Worker threads are **built into Node.js** from version **10.5.0** onwards. No additional installation is required.

---

### **5. Example: Basic Worker Thread**

In this simple example, we create a worker thread to perform a CPU-intensive task (like calculating the sum of large numbers) and return the result to the main thread.

#### **Main Thread (main.js)**

```js
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  // Main thread: create worker
  const worker = new Worker(__filename); // Spawning a worker using the same file

  worker.on("message", (result) => {
    console.log("Result from worker:", result);
    worker.terminate(); // Terminate worker after use
  });

  worker.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Worker error:", err);
  });

  worker.on("exit", (code) => {
    if (code !== 0) {
      console.log(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`);
    }
  });
} else {
  // Worker thread: perform task
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  parentPort.postMessage(sum); // Send the result to the main thread
}
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Main Thread**:
  - Creates a worker using the same file (`__filename`).
  - Listens for the worker's result via the `message` event and terminates the worker after use.
- **Worker Thread**:
  - Performs the computation (summing numbers up to 1 billion) in parallel to the main thread.
  - Sends the result back to the main thread using `parentPort.postMessage()`.

---

## **6. Worker Thread Communication**

Worker threads communicate using **message passing**, allowing the main thread to send data to the worker, and the worker can send results back to the main thread.

### **Example: Sending and Receiving Messages**

```js
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");

const worker = new Worker("./worker.js");

worker.postMessage("Start computation"); // Sending message to worker

worker.on("message", (msg) => {
  console.log("Message from worker:", msg); // Handling message from worker
});

worker.on("error", (err) => console.error("Worker error:", err));

worker.on("exit", (code) => {
  if (code !== 0) console.log(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`);
});
```

#### **Worker (`worker.js`)**

```js
const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");

parentPort.on("message", (msg) => {
  console.log("Message received:", msg);
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) sum += i; // Perform heavy computation
  parentPort.postMessage(`Computation result: ${sum}`);
});
```

âœ… **How It Works**:

- The **main thread** sends a message to the worker.
- The **worker** performs a task and sends the result back to the main thread.

## **7. Shared Memory in Worker Threads**

One of the key features of worker threads is the ability to **share memory** between the main thread and workers using **SharedArrayBuffer** and **Atomics**.

### **Example: Shared Memory Between Main and Worker**

```js
const { Worker, SharedArrayBuffer, Atomics } = require("worker_threads");

const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(4); // Create shared memory buffer
const view = new Int32Array(buffer); // View for manipulating shared memory

const worker = new Worker("./worker.js", { workerData: buffer });

worker.on("message", () => {
  console.log("Worker updated shared memory:", view[0]);
});

worker.postMessage("Start");
```

#### **Worker (`worker.js`)**

```js
const { parentPort, workerData } = require("worker_threads");
const view = new Int32Array(workerData);

Atomics.store(view, 0, 42); // Modify the shared memory
parentPort.postMessage("Shared memory updated");
```

âœ… **Explanation**:

- A `SharedArrayBuffer` allows both the main thread and worker to access the same memory region.
- `Atomics.store()` ensures that the memory is safely updated.

## **8. When to Use Worker Threads?**

Worker threads are useful for **CPU-intensive operations** that could block the main thread. They are ideal for:

- **Data processing**: Parsing large files, sorting large datasets.
- **Complex calculations**: AI algorithms, image processing, machine learning.
- **Handling multiple simultaneous tasks** that require **parallel processing**.

| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overhead**                          | More memory usage than single-threaded processing                             |
| **Complexity**                        | Requires managing threads and handling concurrency safely                     |
| **IPC (Inter-process Communication)** | While fast, message passing and shared memory require careful synchronization |

| **Use Case**         | CPU-intensive tasks            | Web server scaling (multi-core utilization) |
| **Parallelism**      | True multi-threading           | Multiple processes handling requests        |
| **Resource Sharing** | Shared memory                  | Separate memory for each process            |
