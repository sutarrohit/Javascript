# 1. NPM Workspaces :

**npm Workspaces** allow you to manage multiple related Node.js projects (or packages) within a **single repository** using one `package.json`. It simplifies dependency management and is useful for **monorepos** (projects containing multiple packages).

Introduced in **npm v7**, Workspaces help organize projects like:

- **Monorepos** (e.g., multiple frontend and backend apps in one repo).
- **Modular projects** (e.g., shared UI components in separate packages).

---

## **1. Setting Up npm Workspaces**

To use Workspaces, create a **root project** with a `package.json` file containing:

```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

- `"private": true` prevents accidental publishing to npm.
- `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` means all subdirectories inside `packages/` are workspaces.

---

## **2. Creating Workspaces (Sub-Packages)**

Inside the root directory, create a `packages/` folder and add sub-packages:

```sh
mkdir -p packages/app packages/lib
```

Each sub-package gets its own `package.json`:

### **`packages/app/package.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

### **`packages/lib/package.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "lib",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.5.0"
  }
}
```

---

## **3. Installing Dependencies for All Workspaces**

Run the following command in the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

- Installs dependencies for all workspaces.
- Creates a **single `node_modules` folder** at the root (no duplicate dependencies).

To install a package for a specific workspace:

```sh
npm install express -w packages/app
```

This installs `express` only in `packages/app`.

---

## **4. Linking Workspaces (Internal Dependencies)**

If `app` depends on `lib`, you can link them like this:

Inside `packages/app/package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lib": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Now run:

```sh
npm install
```

`npm` automatically links `lib` to `app` without needing `npm link`!

---

## **5. Running Scripts in Workspaces**

You can run scripts inside specific workspaces using:

```sh
npm run build -w packages/app
```

To run scripts for **all workspaces**:

```sh
npm run test --workspaces
```

---

## **6. Listing Workspaces**

To see all workspaces in a project:

```sh
npm ls --workspaces
```

---

## **7. Removing Dependencies from a Specific Workspace**

To uninstall `lodash` from `packages/app`:

```sh
npm uninstall lodash -w packages/app
```

---

## **8. Advantages of npm Workspaces**

✅ **Single `node_modules` folder** → Faster installs, avoids duplication.  
✅ **Simplified dependency management** → Easily link packages.  
✅ **Run commands across multiple packages** → Automate testing/building.  
✅ **Better monorepo structure** → Manage multiple projects efficiently.

---

## **9. Alternative Tools**

npm Workspaces are great, but other tools exist:

- **Yarn Workspaces** → More advanced features.
- **pnpm Workspaces** → Faster and optimized package sharing.
- **Lerna** → Manages large monorepos with versioning and publishing.
