# 1. **`process.nextTick()` in Node.js**

`process.nextTick()` is a **Node.js function** that schedules a callback to be executed **immediately after the current operation completes**, before the event loop continues to the next phase.

It is part of the **Microtask Queue**, which takes priority over the **event loop phases**.

---

## **1. Syntax**

```js
process.nextTick(callback, [arg1], [arg2], ...);
```

- **`callback`** ‚Üí The function to execute.
- **`arg1, arg2, ...`** ‚Üí Optional arguments passed to the callback.

---

## **2. Example Usage**

```js
console.log("Start");

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log("Executed in nextTick");
});

console.log("End");
```

### **Output:**

```
Start
End
Executed in nextTick
```

**Explanation:**

- `process.nextTick()` executes **after synchronous code**, but **before the event loop continues**.

---

## **3. `process.nextTick()` vs. `setImmediate()`**

Both `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` schedule code execution, but they behave differently.

### **Comparison Example**

```js
setImmediate(() => console.log("setImmediate executed"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick executed"));
```

### **Output:**

```
nextTick executed
setImmediate executed
```

**Why?**

- `process.nextTick()` runs **before the event loop resumes**.
- `setImmediate()` runs **after the current event loop phase completes**.

---

## **4. `process.nextTick()` in I/O Operations**

`process.nextTick()` executes **before I/O callbacks**, even if inside an I/O operation.

### **Example:**

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  console.log("I/O callback");

  process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick inside I/O"));
  setImmediate(() => console.log("setImmediate inside I/O"));
});
```

### **Output:**

```
I/O callback
nextTick inside I/O
setImmediate inside I/O
```

**Why?**

- **I/O callback runs first** (since the file read is complete).
- **`process.nextTick()` executes before the event loop moves to the next phase**.
- **`setImmediate()` executes in the next event loop iteration**.

---

## **5. When to Use `process.nextTick()`**

‚úÖ When **a task must run before I/O or timers**.  
‚úÖ When a **callback should execute immediately after the current function completes**.  
‚úÖ To **prioritize execution of microtasks** over other asynchronous tasks.

---

## **6. Warning: `process.nextTick()` Can Block the Event Loop**

Using `process.nextTick()` inside itself **infinitely** can block the event loop.

### **Example: Blocking the Event Loop**

```js
function infiniteLoop() {
  console.log("Blocking...");
  process.nextTick(infiniteLoop);
}

infiniteLoop();
```

üö® **This will freeze the application!**  
Since `process.nextTick()` **always runs before the event loop continues**, it prevents other tasks from executing.

---

### **Conclusion**

- `process.nextTick()` executes **before any event loop phase**.
- It takes **higher priority than I/O, timers, and `setImmediate()`**.
- Use it **carefully** to avoid blocking the event loop.

### **Visual Representation of `process.nextTick()` in the Node.js Event Loop**

The **Node.js event loop** consists of multiple phases, but `process.nextTick()` **executes before the event loop moves to the next phase**. It is part of the **Microtask Queue** (like Promises).

---

### **üìå Event Loop Phases and `process.nextTick()` Execution Order**

```
--------------------------------
|   Synchronous Code Runs      |  ‚Üí Runs first
--------------------------------
|   process.nextTick() Queue   |  ‚Üí Runs before event loop continues
--------------------------------
|   Event Loop Starts          |
|   Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)   |
|   I/O Callbacks Phase        |
|   Poll Phase                 |
|   Check Phase (setImmediate) |
|   Close Callbacks Phase      |
--------------------------------
```

- `process.nextTick()` runs **before the event loop phases**.
- `setImmediate()` runs **in the Check Phase**, after I/O operations.

---

### **üìå Example: Execution Order**

```js
console.log("1Ô∏è‚É£ Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("5Ô∏è‚É£ setTimeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("6Ô∏è‚É£ setImmediate"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("2Ô∏è‚É£ process.nextTick"));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("3Ô∏è‚É£ Promise resolved"));

console.log("4Ô∏è‚É£ End");
```

### **Expected Output:**

```
1Ô∏è‚É£ Start
4Ô∏è‚É£ End
2Ô∏è‚É£ process.nextTick
3Ô∏è‚É£ Promise resolved
5Ô∏è‚É£ setTimeout
6Ô∏è‚É£ setImmediate
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Synchronous code executes first** (`Start` and `End`).
2. **Microtasks (`process.nextTick()` & Promises) run next**, before the event loop continues.
3. **Timers (`setTimeout(0)`) run in the Timers Phase**.
4. **`setImmediate()` runs in the Check Phase**.

### **üìå Key Takeaways**

‚úî **`process.nextTick()` executes immediately after synchronous code** but before the event loop resumes.  
‚úî **Higher priority than `setTimeout()` and `setImmediate()`**.  
‚úî **Avoid infinite `process.nextTick()` loops** to prevent blocking the event loop.
