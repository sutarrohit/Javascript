# 1. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

An **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** is a JavaScript function that is defined and executed immediately after it is created. It is a common design pattern used to execute a function immediately and create a separate scope for variables.

### **Syntax**

The general syntax of an IIFE is:

```javascript
(function () {
  // Code here runs immediately
})();
```

### **Key Features**

1. **Immediate Execution**: The function is executed as soon as it is defined.
2. **Isolated Scope**: The function creates its own execution context and scope, avoiding conflicts with other parts of the code.
3. **Self-contained Logic**: It is often used to encapsulate logic without polluting the global scope.

### **How It Works**

- The function is wrapped in parentheses to treat it as a function expression rather than a function declaration.
- The `()` after the function invokes it immediately.

### **Examples**

#### 1. Basic IIFE

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log("This IIFE runs immediately!");
})();
// Output: This IIFE runs immediately!
```

#### 2. With Parameters

```javascript
(function (name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
})("Alice");
// Output: Hello, Alice!
```

#### 3. Returning a Value

```javascript
const result = (function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
})(5, 3);

console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

### **Use Cases**

1. **Avoid Global Variable Pollution**

   - Variables inside an IIFE are scoped to the function and do not leak to the global scope.

   ```javascript
   (function () {
     const privateVar = "I'm private";
     console.log(privateVar); // Accessible here
   })();

   // console.log(privateVar); // Error: privateVar is not defined
   ```

2. **Module Pattern**

   - IIFEs are often used to create modules with private variables and methods.

   ```javascript
   const myModule = (function () {
     const privateVar = "This is private";
     function privateMethod() {
       return privateVar;
     }
     return {
       publicMethod: privateMethod,
     };
   })();

   console.log(myModule.publicMethod()); // Output: This is private
   ```

3. **Executing One-Time Code**
   - Run setup or initialization code once without polluting the global scope.
   ```javascript
   (function () {
     console.log("App initialized");
   })();
   ```

### **Arrow Function as IIFE**

IIFEs can also be written using arrow functions:

```javascript
(() => {
  console.log("Arrow function IIFE");
})();
// Output: Arrow function IIFE
```

### **Advantages of IIFE**

1. **Avoid Name Conflicts**: Encapsulates code to prevent conflicts with other scripts.
2. **Immediate Execution**: Useful for initialization or one-time setups.
3. **Private Variables**: Hides implementation details and exposes only necessary functionality.

### **Disadvantages**

1. **Readability**: Overuse of IIFEs can make the code harder to read.
2. **Debugging**: Debugging becomes slightly challenging due to the immediate execution.

### **Modern Usage**

With the introduction of ES6 modules, IIFEs are less common for encapsulation because modules naturally create their own scope. However, IIFEs are still valuable for scripts that need immediate execution, especially in environments where modules are not used.
