### **Lexical Scoping in JavaScript**

**Lexical scoping** refers to the fact that the accessibility of variables and functions is determined by their position (or location) in the source code. The scope of a variable is fixed during the compilation phase and does not change at runtime.

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping** to determine which variables are accessible in a particular function or block of code.

---

### **How Lexical Scoping Works**

1. **Scope Defined by Code Structure**:

   - Variables and functions are resolved based on where they are declared in the code, not where they are called from.

2. **Nested Scopes**:
   - If a variable is not found in the current scope, JavaScript looks for it in the outer (parent) scope, continuing this process until it reaches the global scope. This process is called **scope chaining**.

---

### **Example of Lexical Scoping**

```javascript
function outer() {
  const outerVariable = "I am from outer scope";

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Can access outerVariable
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
// Output: "I am from outer scope"
```

- In the example above:
  - The `inner` function is **lexically scoped** inside the `outer` function.
  - The `inner` function has access to variables declared in its parent scope (`outer`).

---

### **Scope Chain**

- The **scope chain** is a hierarchy of nested scopes that JavaScript uses to resolve variables.
- When a variable is referenced, JavaScript checks:
  1. The current function's scope.
  2. The parent scope.
  3. Continue up to the global scope.
  4. If the variable is not found, it results in a `ReferenceError`.

#### **Example**

```javascript
const globalVar = "global";

function outer() {
  const outerVar = "outer";

  function inner() {
    const innerVar = "inner";
    console.log(innerVar); // Found in inner scope
    console.log(outerVar); // Found in outer scope
    console.log(globalVar); // Found in global scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

**Output**:

```
inner
outer
global
```

### **Lexical Scoping vs Dynamic Scoping**

- **Lexical Scoping**: The scope is determined by the code structure.
- **Dynamic Scoping**: The scope is determined by the execution context (runtime).

JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, not dynamic scoping.

---

### **Practical Applications of Lexical Scoping**

#### 1. **Closures**

- A closure occurs when a function retains access to its parentâ€™s variables even after the parent function has completed execution.

Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  const outerVariable = "I am still accessible";

  return function inner() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  };
}

const closureFunc = outer();
closureFunc(); // Output: "I am still accessible"
```

#### 2. **Encapsulation**

- Lexical scoping is used to encapsulate variables and avoid polluting the global scope.

Example:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Output: 2
```

---

### **Key Points**

1. **Scope is Static**: Lexical scope is determined at the time of writing code and does not change at runtime.
2. **Parent-Child Relationship**: Inner functions have access to variables in their parent functions.
3. **Global Scope**: The outermost scope is the global scope, and it is accessible to all functions unless shadowed.

---

### **Common Mistakes**

1. **Confusion with `this`**:

   - Lexical scoping is about variable access, not the `this` keyword. `this` is determined dynamically based on how a function is called.

2. **Variable Shadowing**:

   - If a variable in an inner scope has the same name as one in an outer scope, the inner variable shadows the outer one.

   ```javascript
   const value = "outer";

   function test() {
     const value = "inner";
     console.log(value); // Output: "inner"
   }

   test();
   ```

3. **Block Scoping in `let` and `const`**:
   - Unlike `var`, `let` and `const` create block-scoped variables.
   ```javascript
   if (true) {
     let blockVar = "I exist inside this block";
     console.log(blockVar); // Works
   }
   console.log(blockVar); // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
   ```

---

3. **Example**:

```javascript
function af() {
  var b = 20;
  bf();
  function bf() {
    var c = 40;
    cf();
    console.log("");
    console.log("value of the a==========", a); //10
    console.log("value of the b==========", b); //20
    console.log("value of the c ==========", c); //40

    function cf() {
      var d = 50;
      console.log("value of the a-----------", a); //10
      console.log("value of the b-----------", b); //20
      console.log("value of the c ----------", c); //40
      console.log("value of the d ----------", d); //50
    }
  }
}

var a = 10;
af();
```
